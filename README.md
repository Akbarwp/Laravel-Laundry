# Laravel Laundry

The laundry business is increasingly popular as a source of adequate income, exemplified by the initiative led by the village head of Simokerto, Surabaya, which operates five locations. However, the management of transactions remains traditional, and the lack of monitoring has resulted in minimal information about the laundry's progress. To address socio-economic disparities in Simokerto, the village head has involved underprivileged families (Gamis) in a labor-intensive laundry program, where income from laundry services is allocated to the laundry itself, while additional services like ironing and delivery are designated for Gamis.

The challenges faced include insufficient monitoring of Gamis, with only one or two successfully employed, as the village head lacks clear information on whether those hired are part of Gamis. Another challenge is the increasing number of transactions, leading to long queues and disrupting service delivery, which may cause customer dissatisfaction.

This research proposes a solution in the form of an application that can monitor the laundry program, facilitating the social program for Gamis, implementing priority services, and generating digital reports. The application is built using the Priority Service method, helping to manage data, transactions, and effectively monitor the Gamis social program in the laundry business.

This application is the result of my Tugas Akhir (Thesis), which I have been working on over the past few months. The project not only fulfills the requirements for completing my degree but also serves as an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve gained throughout my studies. By developing this application, I hope to offer a practical solution that benefits the community while showcasing my abilities in software development. Moreover, this project reflects my dedication and commitment to completing my education and making a positive contribution to my surroundings.
